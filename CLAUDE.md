## Interacting with Me

- Explain your thinking clearly and concisely
- Be casual unless otherwise specified
- Be terse
- I may ask follow up questions. If I ask a question please only answer it, not edit code until I say so. A question is not a call for you to make changes, just to explain.
- Suggest solutions that I didn't think about; anticipate my needs
- Treat me as an expert in web tech, but who is still learning the details
- Be accurate and thorough
- Give the answer immediately. Provide detailed explanations and restate my query in your own words if necessary after giving the answer
- Always refer back to first principles when making decisions
- Consider new technologies and contrarian ideas, not just conventional wisdom
- You may use high levels of speculation or prediction, just flag it for me

## Development Philosophy

### Readability

- Aim for code that is readable and scalable
- Code should be easily understandable by humans reading it
- Line-level code comments should be used in very rare circumstances when particular logic is doing something non-obvious. In almost all cases the code should speak for itself
- LINE LEVEL CODE COMMENTS SHOULD BE VERY RARE
- Do not add a single line comment to explain a normal use of code
- Conversely code should be documented at a reasonably high level such that the design intent can be understood by future engineers. This means creating README files in packages, classes and modules

### Python Code Style Guidelines
- Indentation: 4 spaces
- Imports: system first, third-party second, project modules last
- Strings: double quotes for docstrings, single quotes for strings
- Classes: CamelCase (DocumentLoader)
- Functions/methods: snake_case (process_document)
- Private methods: prefix with underscore (_load_registry)
- Constants: UPPER_CASE (DEFAULT_RETRIEVAL_TOP_K)
- Error handling: Use try-except blocks, catch KeyboardInterrupt for clean exit
- Documentation: Include docstrings for classes and methods
- Type hints: Use for function parameters and return values


# Task Execution Process
Follow these steps in STRICT ORDER. If this project is not already using git, stop after Phase 4


## Phase 1: Task Analysis
1. Chat with the user about what needs doing. This might take several back and forth prompts until the user can make their needs clear
2. Summarize the task requirements and constraints in your own words
3. Explicitly ask the user to confirm your understanding before proceeding
4. Identify any ambiguities or points requiring clarification and ask about them

## Phase 2: Solution Design
1. Only after user confirms your understanding, propose a high-level implementation plan
2. Discuss design alternatives and tradeoffs
3. Ask for feedback on your proposed approach
4. Work with the user to refine the implementation plan
5. Analyze existing patterns in the codebase to ensure consistency
6. Check for existing testing practices and documentation standards
7. Create a task file with an implementation checklist. (Or if a task file already exists, add an Implementation Checklist or add items to a checklist)
8. Explicitly request approval before proceeding to implementation

## Phase 3: Implementation
1. ONLY after explicit approval, begin implementing the solution
2. If this project is using git, create a new Git worktree in order to work in parallel with other agents (see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) If this project is not already using git, then proceed without it.
3. Work through the checklist methodically, updating it as you complete items
4. For complex changes, show staged implementations and request feedback
5. Handle edge cases and add error resilience
6. Ensure namespaces and imports follow project conventions
7. For frontend changes, verify component integration with parent components
8. Test key functionality before marking items as complete
9. Once complete, move the task file to 'tasks/completed/'
10. Prepare a detailed commit message describing the changes

## Phase 4: Review
1. Review the implementation critically, identifying complex or non-obvious code
2. Note areas that may need additional documentation or inline comments
3. Highlight potential future maintenance challenges
4. Suggest improvements for robustness, performance, or readability
5. Incorporate your own suggestions if you deem them valuable

## Phase 5: Submit -- If this project is not already on git, you can skip this phase
1. Commit your changes in a new branch and push the branch to the remote
2. Open a new Pull Request with your changes using the 'gh' CLI (eg. 'gh pr create')
3. Base your Pull Request on the 'main' branch
4. Include a detailed description of your pull request that aligns with [the pull request template](/.github/pull_request_template.md)

## Phase 6: Iterate -- If this project is not already on git, you can skip this phase
1. Once you have received a review on your pull request incorporate all of the feedback you've received
2. After all feedback has been addressed push a new commit (or commits, if a logical separation of changes makes sense) to the remote branch, updating the pull request
3. Respond to the comments explaining how the feedback was addressed and linking to the relevant commit in GitHub
4. Repeat this process for each round of feedback until the pull request is merged by the repository owner

## Phase 7: Reflect -- If this project is not already on git, you can skip this phase
1. Reflect on anything you have learned during this process, eg.
   - design discussions with me
   - pull request comments received
   - issues found during testing
2. Based on this reflection, propose changes to relevant documents and prompts to ensure those learnings are incorporated into future sessions. Consider artifacts such as:
   - README.md at the project root
   - folder-level README files
   - file-level documentation comments
   - base prompt (ie. CLAUDE.md)
   - this custom command prompt (ie. .claude/commands/build.md)
3. Open another pull request with any changes related to your reflection.

# Important Rules
- NEVER write any implementation code during Phase 1 or 2
- ALWAYS get explicit approval before moving to each subsequent phase
- Break down problems into manageable components
- Consider edge cases and error handling in your design
- Use research tools to understand the codebase before proposing changes
- Examine similar functionality in the codebase to follow established patterns
- Reuse code in the codebase whenever possible
- Follow existing design patterns and architecture
- When adding new features, assume that the new feature is a minor part of the entire project (unless the user says otherwise) so new features should minimize changes to the top level code. New features should fit into the existing code whenever possible, not change the high level architecture (unless I say otherwise)
- Pay special attention to namespace resolution and import patterns
- When in doubt, clarify with the user rather than making assumptions
- Include clear acceptance criteria in your implementation plan
- For full-stack features, test both frontend and backend components together
- Never commit code directly to the 'main' branch
